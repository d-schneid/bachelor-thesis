\section{Time Series}
In this thesis, a time series $X$ shall be defined as an ordered sequence of $N \geq 1$ real-valued observations $X = x_1, ..., x_N$, that shall be observed at uniformly spaced points in time $T = t_1, ..., t_N$ \cite{Survey_Esling}. $N$ shall be called the length of the time series. \newline
Furthermore, a subsequence $S$ of a time series $X$ of length $N$ shall be defined as a time series of length $1 \leq M \leq N$ that consists of contiguous observations from $X$, such that $S = x_k, x_{k+1}, ..., x_{k+M-1}$ with $1 \leq k \leq N-M+1$ \cite{Survey_Esling}.
