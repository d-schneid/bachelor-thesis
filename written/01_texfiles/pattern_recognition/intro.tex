\chapter{Motif Discovery} \label{subsection_motif_discovery}
Motif discovery is the task of finding all recurrently occurring subsequences in a given time series \cite{Survey_Esling}. More formally, let $X = x_1, ..., x_N$ be a time series of length $N \ge 1$. Then, the task of motif discovery is to find all subsequences $S = s_1, ..., s_M$ of length $1 \leq M < N$ that recurrently occur in $X$ (see Figure \ref{fig:intro_motifs}) \cite{Survey_Esling}. \newline
The determination of recurrently occurring subsequences in $X$ involves a similarity measurement between subsequences based on a given similarity measure $D$ (e.g. the Euclidean distance) and a given similarity distance $r \geq 0$ \cite{Motif_Definitions}. Two subsequences $S_1$ and $S_2$ of $X$ are then called matching subsequences if and only if \mbox{$D(S_1,S_2) \leq r$} \cite{Motif_Definitions}. Moreover, trivially matching subsequences of $X$ are defined as matching subsequences whose starting points in time are not further apart than a given $k \geq 0$ points in time \cite{Motif_Definitions}. Based on matching subsequences, recurrently occurring subsequences in $X$ can be found as explained for the following motif discovery algorithms. Further note that the recurrent occurrence of a subsequence in a given time series is relative to the given similarity measure and the given similarity distance.
